## CSS Grid Introduction and Terminology

**CSS Grid Layout** is a two-dimensional grid system.

_When working with CSS Grids, use Mozilla Firefox, as it has the best developer tools to visualize the CSS Grid layouts._

- First, create a **Grid Container** with `{ display: grid; }`. Then, all the direct children of the grid container are called **Grid Items**.

- **Row Axis** in the _X direction_ and **Column Axis** in the _Y direction_. Axes are unchangeable in CSS Grids.

- **Grid Line:** the vertical and horizontal lines that divide up the grid items, and separate the columns and the rows.

- **Grid Cell:** the area between 2 adjacent vertical and 2 adjacent horizontal grid lines.

- **Grid Track:** the space between two adjacent grid lines. Think of them as the columns or rows of the grid.

- **Grid Area:** the area surrounded by four or more grid lines.

- **Gutter:** the space between the rows and columns.

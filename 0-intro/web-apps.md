## **Web Applications**

A web application is an application software that does not require installation and can instead be accessed from a remove server via a web browser.

Web applications are made for interaction, allowing users to send and consume data between the browser and the web server.

## **The Difference between Website and Web application**

A **website** can be defined as pages of content accessed through a web browser.

A web application is an application software that runs on a web server and is accessed by the user through a web browser (**focus on interaction with the user**).

Web applications are significantly more complicated than static websites (complex architecture and features).

## **Web Application Architecture**

In order to facilitate this complex flow of data, web applications are usually designed with different layers. The most common design paradigm is a three-layered design consisting of a presentation layer (web browser), application layer (server), and storage layer (database). In this system, the presentation layer is responsible for relaying user data to the application layer, which can process that data and do any number of things, including passing it to the storage layer for “safe-keeping.”

Many times, web applications can grow to be very complex. In these cases, a three-layered design may fall short. This may necessitate the introduction of additional layers to handle this complexity. For instance, the introduction of an integration layer between the application and storage layers can help provide a uniform interface for data access, allowing the application layer to be insulated from changes that occur to the storage layer implementation.

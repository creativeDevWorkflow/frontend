## **A Component Render another Component**

Render methods can return component instances as well.

```JSX
import { NavBar } from './NavBar.js';
import { CtaComp } from './CtaComp.js';

class Header extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <header>
                <NavBar />
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <CtaComp />
            </header>
        );
    };
};
```

Nesting components inside of other components - complex architectures - the fundamental relationship of React.js.

## **this.props**

A component can pass information to another component.

Information that gets passed from one component to another is known as â€œprops".

Terminology:

- `props` is the name of the object that stores passed-in information.
- `this.props` refers to that storage object.
- At the same time, each piece of passed-in information is called `a prop`.

### **Access a Component's props**

Every component has something called `props`. A component's `props` is an object. It holds information about that component.

```JSX
render() {
    console.log(this.props);
    return '';
}
```

### **Pass `props` to a Component**

We can pass information to a React component by giving it attributes like real data:

```JSX
<MyComponent message="Love you" num={10} user={false} arr={[1, 2, 3]} />
```

We pass information to a component by defining an attribute name and then the data.

The values that aren't strings must be wrapper in curly braces.

### **Render a Component's props**

To access props, inside the component's body, use `this.props` + the name of the attribute:

```JSX
render() {
    return this.props.message;
}
```

Common practice to render a component instance from another component, and also defining the props from that parent component.

### **Make decision with props**

```JSX
if (this.props.age >= 25) return 'Sir';
```

### **Event Handler in a Component Class**

```JSX
class Example extends React.Component {
    clickEvent() {
        console.log('Ow, you clicked me ðŸ‘‹');
    }

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.clickEvent}>Click</button>;
    }
}
```

First, we define our event handler function, then we asign it as value in the `onClick` attribute.

### **Pass and Receive an Event Handler as a prop**

```JSX
export class Button extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.props.onClick}>Click</button>;
    }
}
```

```JSX
import { Button } from 'btn.js';

class Example extends React.Component {
    handleClick() {
        console.log('Click');
    }

    render() {
        return <Button onClick={this.handleClick} />;
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(
    <Example />,
    document.querySelector('main')
);
```

First we define the event function in our importing component class.

Then we attach the event handler in the exporting Button component, like: `onClick={this.props.onClick}`.

Finally, we render our Button component and also provide the event function so that Button could access it from props.

### **Naming convention: handleEvent and onEvent**

- Event functions: keyword `handle` plus the type of the event `Click`
- Props: keyword `on` and the type of the event `Click`

Keywords like `onClick` only create event listeners if they're used on HTML-like JSX elements, like in the Button component above. Otherwise, they're just ordinary prop names.

### **this.props.children**

Components can have a closing tag, not only self-closing:

```JSX
console.log(this.props.children); // Hello World

<MyComponentClass>
    Hello World
</MyComponentClass>
```

`props` object has a property named `children` which will return everything in between a component's opening and closing JSX tags.

If a component has more than one child between its JSX tags, then `children` will return those children in an array.

If the component is an self-closing tag, then `children` will be undefined.

### **defaultProps**

We can set default properties for situation when we property was not defined:

```JSX
class Example extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <p>{this.props.text}</p>;
    }
}

Example.defaultProps = {
    text: 'Hello'
}
```

First the name of the component and then `.defaultProps`, and equal to an object.

In this object, we can write properties for any default props.

<br>

## **this.state**

React components will often need dynamic information (information that can change) in order to render.

There are two ways for a React Component to access dynamic information: `props` and `states`.

Besides `props` and `states`, every value in a component should always stay exactly the same.

### **Setting initial state**

```JSX
class Example extends React.Component {

    contructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { age: 25 }
    }

    render() {
        return <p>{this.state.age}</p>;
    }
}
```

To make a component have `state`, we define the `state` property inside the `constructor` method, like above example. `this.state` should be equal to an object.

React components always have to call super in their constructors to be set up properly.

Then we can access state from our class as usual: `this.state.name-of-property`.

### **Update state with `this.setState`**

A component changes its state by calling the function:

```JSX
this.setState({age: 26});
```

This `setState` function takes 2 arguments: an object that will update the component's state and a callback (which you basically never need).

By calling this function like above with an object, it merges that object with the component's current state. If there are properties in the current state that arenâ€™t part of that object, then those properties remain how they were.

You canâ€™t call this.setState() from inside of the render function.

Note: Any time that you call this.setState(), this function will automatically call .render() as soon as the state has changed. This is also why we can not place setState inside the render function.

A React app is basically just a lot of components, setting state and passing props to one another.

# CSS Modules

[**CSS Modules**](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) are CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

CSS Modules is not an official implementation in the browser, but rather a process in the build step that changes class names and selectors to be scoped.

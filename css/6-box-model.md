# **The Box Model**

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box. Each box can have (optional):

1. The _content area_'s size (width and height)
2. _Padding_ (space between content area and border)
3. _Border_ (thickness and style surrounding content area and padding)
4. _Margin_ (space between border and the outside edge of the element)

By default, the total dimensions of an element, are the sum of the content size, padding, border and margin.

## **Table of Content**

- [Height and Width](#height-and-width)
- [Border](#border)
- [Padding](#padding)
- [Margin](#margin)
- [Vertical Margin Collapse](#vertical-margin-collapse)
- [Minimum and Maximum Height and Width](#minimum-and-maximum-height-and-width)
- [Overflow](#overflow)
- [Resetting Defaults](#resetting-defaults)
- [Visibility](#visibility)
- [box-sizing](#box-sizing)

## **Height and Width**

By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the content of the box. We can change that with:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 350px;
}
```

<br>

## **Border**

Border is a line that surrounds an element. It can be set with a specific width, style and color:

```CSS
div {
    border: 2px solid red;
    border-radius: 5px;  /* 50% = circle */
}
```

`border-radius` will change the radius of the corners of an element's border box.

<br>

## **Padding**

The space between the content and the border of a box.

We can set padding for each side of the box separately.

```css
div {
  padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; /* top right bottom left */
}
```

Padding is often used to expand the background color of the box.

<br>

## **Margin**

The space outside of the box.

```css
div {
  margin: 10px auto;
}
```

Using `margin: 0 auto;` we can center elements. `auto` on left and right instructs the browser to adjust margins until the element is centered within its containing element.

<br>

## **Vertical Margin Collapse**

Concept not applied to horizontal margin or to padding in general.

_Top and bottom (vertical) margins collapse._

Between two adjacent elements, both with defined margin, only the larger margin is set.

```css
.div-1 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.div-2 {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```

In the example above, as this two margins meet, only the 20px padding of div-2 is applied.

<br>

## **Minimum and Maximum Height and Width**

CSS properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element's box can be sized to.

```css
div {
  max-width: 600px;
  min-width: 300px;

  max-height: 500px;
  min-height: 200px;
}
```

<br>

## **Overflow**

`overflow` property is set on a parent element to instruct the browser how to render child elements. It controls what happens to content that spills or overflows outside its box.

```css
div {
  overflow: visible;
}
```

- `visible` (default value) the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element.
- `hidden` any content that overflows will be hidden.
- `scroll` (a scrollbar will be added) the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.

For vertical or horizontal solutions: `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`.

<br>

## **Resetting Defaults**

Browsers have a default stylesheet, known as _user agent stylesheets_.

Many properties in CSS have a default value and donâ€™t have to be explicitly set in the stylesheet.

User agent stylesheets usually have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin.

Reset margin and padding default values:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This is often the first CSS rule in an external stylesheet.

When properties are set to `0`, they do not require a unit of measurement.

<br>

## **Visibility**

```css
div {
  visibility: visible;
}
```

- `hidden` hides an element
- `visible` (default) displays an element
- `collapse` collapses an element

_Difference between display and visibility:_

- `display: none;` will completely remove an element from the document.
- `visibility: hidden` the element will not be visible, but the space reserved for it will. The element is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.

<br>

## **box-sizing**

`box-sizing` property controls the box model type. Its default value is `content-box`. This means that the actual size of elements is calculated by adding padding, border and width or height of the element. This can lead to unexpected results.

We can reset this behaviour of the box model for all html elements with:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, so that the overall dimensions of the box do not change.

Include this CSS reset along with the previous one with border and padding set to `0`.

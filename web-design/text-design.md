# Text Design

<br>

- Make sure that your text is big enough (over 16px).
- Have a strong contrast between the foreground and the background.
- Make sure there is enough space between lines and letters (remember, whitespace is king!)

The average internet paragraph is only 1-3 sentences. It’s actually better to avoid sentences and paragraphs whenever possible and use a list instead.

Line Length: The best bet is to aim to have columns that contain roughly 50-75 characters per line.

## Primacy and Recency

People will notice and remember the first and last elements of a list or a page better than anything in the middle of the list/page. This is known as Primacy and Recency effects. You can utilize this neurological behavior when organizing the text on your site to make sure that users remember what you want them to remember.

## Image Pairing

Users eyes are easily drawn to images quicker than they are to text. You can utilize this by pairing important text with images whenever appropriate.

## F-Shaped Skimming

Users will scan content on the left of the screen before the right of the screen, and the top of the screen before the bottom of the screen. Our eyes jump back to the left of the screen whenever we finish reading a line. This creates an F pattern that the user’s eye follows, and is thus known as f-shaped skimming.

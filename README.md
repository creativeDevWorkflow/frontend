In 1969, The United States Department of Defense funded the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a precursor network to the internet. ARPANET connected supercomputing centers run by government agencies and universities.

In 1970s, the transmission control protocol and internet protocol (TCP / IP), were created to provide standards around the transfer of data that would allow these early networks to communicate with each other. In 1980s, TCP/IP was adopted, which resulted in creating the known internet.

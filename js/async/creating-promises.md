## Promises Introduction

**Promises** are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation.

<div></div>

- Promise: an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.

<div></div>

- Promise: a container for an asynchronous delivered value.

- Promise: a container for a future value. Example of future value: the response from an Ajax call.

_Advantages of using promises:_

<div></div>

- We no longer rely on events and callbacks to handle asynchronous results.

<div></div>

- We chain promises as a sequence and escape callback hell.

Since promises work with asynchronous operations, they are time-sensitive, meaning that promises change over time. We call this the _life cycle of a promise_. A `Promise` object can be in one of 3 states:

1. **Pending:** The initial state - the operation has not completed yet. This is before any value resulting from the asynchronous task is available. During this time, the asynchronous task is still doing its work in the background.

   Then, when the task finishes, the Promise is **Settled**. There are 2 different types of settled promises: _Fulfilled_ and _Rejected_ promises.

2. **Fulfilled:** The operation has completed successfully and the promise now has a _resolved value_

   A fulfilled promise successfully resulted in a value, for example a request's promise might resolve a JSON object as its value after fetching data from an API. The promise received the data and is now available for use.

3. **Rejected:** The operation has failed and the promise has a reason for the failure. The reason is usually an `Error` of some kind during the asynchronous task, for example in case the user is offline.

All promises eventually settle, enabling us to write logic for what to do if the promise fulfills or if it rejects.

_Note:_ A promise is settled only once, and from there the state will remain unchanged. The promise will be either fulfilled or rejected. It's impossible to change the settled state.

These different states are relevant once we use the promise to get a result: **to consume the Promise**. For example we consume a promise that was returned from the fetch function.

Generally, a `Promise` first must be build. In the case of the Fecth API, it's the fetch function that builds the promise and returns it for us to consume. So in this case we don't have to build it ourselves. Most of the times we just consume returned promises from the Fetch function, but sometimes we also need to _build_ a `Promise`.

## Constructing a Promise Object

Promises are objects. We can create new promises using the `Promise` constructor just like many other built-in objects.

```js
const condition = Math.random() >= 0.5;

const execute = (resolve, reject) => {
  if (condition) resolve("âœ…");
  if (!condition) reject("ðŸš«");
};

const newPromise = new Promise(execute);
newPromise.then((res) => err).catch((err) => err); // âœ… or ðŸš«
// const newPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { ... });
```

The `Promise` constructor method takes exactly 1 argument - a function parameter called the _executor function_ which runs automatically when the constructor is called.

The executor function starts an asynchronous operation and dictates how the promise should be settled.

We store the constructor Promise in a variable, which in turn will be our new created promise, just like the `fetch` function.

The executor function is executed with 2 other parameters - 2 function parameters, referred to as the `resolve()` and `reject()` functions. When the `Promise` constructor runs, JavaScript will pass these `resolve()` and `reject()` functions into the executor function as parameters.

Based on some logic, we call `resolve()` or `reject()` to settle the `Promise`.

- `resolve` is a function with one argument that we pass. If this `resolve()` function is invoked then it will change the promise's status from `pending` to `fulfilled`, and the promise's resolved value will be set to the argument passed into `resolve()`.

- `reject` is a function that takes a reason or error as an argument. If `reject()` is invoked, it will change the promise's status from `pending` to `rejected`, and the promise's rejection reason will be set to the argument passed into `reject()`.

In practice, promises settle based on the results of asynchronous operations.

We can consume our `Promise` using the `then()` method. `then()` will handle the `resolve` state, and `catch()` will handle the `reject` state.

### Simulate Asynchronous Behavior using a timer

`setTimeout()` is a Node API that schedule callbacks to be executed after a delay.

```js
const newPromise = function () {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved"), 1000)
  );
};
const settle = newPromise();

settle.then((res) => console.log(res)); // print "Resolved" after 1 second

// Promise using an anonymous function
const settle = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved"), 1000)
);
```

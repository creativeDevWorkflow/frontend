## Why do we need an Event Loop?

JavaScript is a **single-threaded** language. This means that two statements can't be executed simultaneously.

For example, a heavy loaded `for` loop will stop the code execution for some seconds, blocking the next line of code.

But, we can run _non-blocking_ code in JavaScript using the **Event Loop**.

For example, the `setTimeout` function runs asynchronously thanks to the Event Loop.

Even so JavaScript is still single-threaded, the event loop is enabling something called **concurrency**.

<br>

## Concurrency in JavaScript

**Concurrency** in programming means that two or more procedures are executed on the same shared resources (e.g. threads, processes, CPU cores).

Since JS is single-threaded, it isn't using the traditional way of concurrency.

However, we can emulate concurrency using the event loop.

At a hign level, asynchronous code can be pushed to web APIs and then directed back into the stack via the event queue and event loop.

<br>

## What is the Event Loop?

The **event loop** is a system for managing code execution.

The heap and the call stack interact with Node and Web APIs, which pass messages back to the stack via an event queue. The event queue's interaction with the call stack is managed by an event loop.

All together, those parts maintain the order of code execution when we run asynchronous functions.

<br>

## The Components of the Event Loop

- **The Heap** is a block of memory where our objects are stored in an unordered manner. JavaScript variables and objects that are currently in use are stored in the heap.

<br>

- **The Call Stack** tracks what function is currently being run in the code.

  When we invoke a function, a _frame_ for that function is added on the stack. Frames connect the function's arguments and local variables from the heap. Frames enter the stack in a _"last in, first out"_ order.

  ```js
  function foo() {
    return function bar() {
      return function baz() {
        return "I love CodeCademy";
      };
    };
  }
  console.log(foo()()());

  // The Call Stack:
  // 5. baz()
  // 4. bar()
  // 3. foo()
  // 2. console.log(function)
  // 1. global()
  ```

  The currently executing function will be at the top of the stack. Nested frames are added on top of its parent frame. When the function finishes executing, its frame is removed from the stack.

  At the bottom of the Stack we have the **global execution context** `global()` which contains the global variables and lexical environment. Each subsequent frame for a called function has a function execution context that includes the functionâ€™s lexical and variable environment.

  _Review:_ The Call Stack tracks what function is currently being run in the code (the current execution context). When a function runs to completion, it is popped off of the call stack.

<br>

- **The Event Queue** is a list of message corresponding to functions that are waiting to be processed.

  These messages are entering the event queue from sources such as web APIs or async functions that were called and are returning additional events to be handled by the stack.

  Messages enter the queue in a _first in, first out_ order.

  No code is executed in the event queue, instead it holds functions that are waiting to be added back into the stack.

<br>

- **The Event Loop** coordinates the waiting messages in the event queue and their related callbacks.

  When the call stack is empty and if there is anything in the event queue, the event loop will add those to the stack for execution, _one at a time_.

  1. The event loop ensures that the stack is empty.
  2. If it is, it will add the first waiting message.
  3. It will repeat steps 1 and 2 until the stack and queue has cleared.

  Thank to the event loop, JavaScript is a single-threaded, event-driven language that can run non-blocking code asynchronously

# Variable Environment

**Hoisting** (JavaScript mechanism) - makes certain variables accessible in the code before they are declared.

During the creating phase of the execution context, the code is scanned for variable declarations before it is executed, then for each found variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object.

Hoisting does not work the same for all variable types.

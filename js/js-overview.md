## JavaScript Introduction

**JavaScript** is the programming language of the web. With JS, we can:

- Build web apps in the browser, load data from remote servers.
- Van be used in both the frontend and backend of web development.

- It is frequently updated with new versions.
- JS integrates easily with HTML and CSS. - manipulate content or the CSS styles.
- JS allow websites to have interactivity
- JS offers a wide range of frameworks and libraries for complex applications with low overhead.

JavaScript used for servers (server-side JavaScript)

JS can be integrated with other languages to communicate with databases.

Node.JS, or Node, is one of the most popular versions of server-side JavaScript. Node has been used to write large platforms for NASA, eBay and many others. Since Javascript can execute programs out of sequential order, Node can be used to create scalable web applications, messaging platforms, and multiplayer games. This is why Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service depend on Node for some of their services.

Beyond the web, JavaScript has a large presence amongst cross-platform applications. We use some popular standalone desktop apps like Slack, GitHub, Skype, and Tidal. These applications are developed with the JavaScript framework called Electron.js. Electron is excellent for making desktop applications that need to work across different devices regardless of operating system.

In addition, JavaScript has the potential of expanding into other innovative technologies such as virtual reality and gaming. JavaScript can be used for animating, rendering and scaling. JavaScript even has contributed to the internet of things, the technology that makes simple objects, like your fridge, smarter. Everyday devices can become interactive and collect data using JavaScript libraries.

## JavaScript Timeline

- **1994** The NetScape web browser was launched.

- **1995**: Microsoft created IE web browser. Brendan Eich (from NetScape), created the very first version of JavaScript in just 10 days. It was called Mocha, but already had many fundamental features of modern JavaScript.

- **1996:** Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attract Java developers. However, JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java. Opera web browser was launched.

- **1996:** Microsoft copied JavaScript from Netscape and called it JScript. Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization called Ecma International.

- **1997:** Ecma International released ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of the scripting language called ECMAScript 1, shortened ES1. This is the first official standard for JavsScript (ECMAScript is the standard, JavaScript is the language in practice).

  The new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript new features, creating consistency between new and old JS versions.

- **1998** ES2 released. Mozilla Firefox was launched.

- **1999** ES3 was released (regular expressions, try-catch statements).

- **2000 - 2008** The release of ECMAScript 4 (ES4) was abandoned due to differences in committee opinions. During this time: Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome were introduced. HTML5 was released.

- **2009** ES5 (ECMAScript 5) is released with lots of great new features (strict mode, JSON support, methods for strings and arrays). Node.js is launced (JS execution outside the browser).

- **2010** AngularJS framework was released.

- **2011** ES5.1 was released.

- **2013** React.js library and Electron.js framework was released.

- **2014** Vue.js framework was released.

- **2015** ES6 (ES2015 / ECMAScript 2015) was released. The biggest update to the language ever. ECMAScript changes to an annual release cycle in order to ship less features per update. Starting with ES6, is what we call modern JS because of the major additions.

  let and const, arrow functions, classes, parameters with default values, promises for asynchronous actions, array methods, and more.

- **2016 - present** Releases of ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019, etc.

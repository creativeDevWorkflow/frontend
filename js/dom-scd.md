## The `document` object

The `document` object in JavaScript is the door to the DOM structure.

It allows you to access the root node of the DOM tree.

Before you can access a specific element in the page, first you must access the document structure itself.

The `document` object allows scripts to access children of the DOM as properties.

`document.body` here we access the `<body>` element, by using the `body` property of the `document` object.

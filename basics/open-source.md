## Open Source Overview

**Open Source Software** is software whose code is free to view, modify, and distribute. Developers can view the code, suggest changes, point out issues that need to be fixed. It is usually created and maintained by a community of volunteer software developers who collaborate on websites like GitHub.

Every active open source software project has one or more **maintainers**. Besides writing code, their main priority is to review and organize contributions from others. The people who make those contributions are called **contributors**. These are people who submit new code, documentation, or even bug reports to open source projects.

Open Source provides a standard way of implementing common features that the entire developer community can build, test, and maintain together. Many of the commonly used tools in the industry, such as operating systems, internet browsers, and coding languages, are open source projects.

Open source presents important opportunities for develoeprs. Working on an open source project is a great way to network with and learn coding and communication skills from software developers all over the world.

## Open Source Repository Docs

Git repositories, or code bases, are often hosted online using services such as GitHub.

On GitHub, we can configure which groups of people may view or make changes to the source code of our public repositories.

- **README.md** is the standard file for basic repository documentation: Title, summary, code snippet example.

- **LIECENSE.md** File is used to describe the licensing terms for the repository: restrictions for what circumstances it is allowed to be used.

Commonly used license: The MIT license. Resource: [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** files contain policies regarding what behavior is acceptable or not.

Standard code of conduct: [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

## The internet history

The first version of internet (1969) began as ARPANET, an academic research network that was funded by the military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

ARPANET was a project that aimed to connect computers from different locations.

In 1983, ARPANET switched to using TCP / IP network standards, which allowed the transfer of information to and from servers. Until these standards, the internet was used only for transferring information between research institutes.

In the 1980s, the National Science Foundation began funding the Internet. And since 1994, the Internet has been privately operated and financed.

## Where is the internet?

The internet has three basic parts:

- **The last mile** is considered to be the part of the internet that connects the internet source with our devices: wireless connection, wifi towers, fiber optic cables, etc.

- **Data centers** are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content, provided with fast Internet connections, serving users simultaneously.

- **The backbone** consists of long-distance networks (on fiber optic cables) that carry data between data centers and consumers.

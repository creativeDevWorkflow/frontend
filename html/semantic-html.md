## Key Elements

- `<header>` is an introductory container for navigational links within `<nav>` or introductory content containing `<h1>` to `<h6>` headings.

- `<nav>` is used to define a block of navigation links, usually within `<header>`.

- `<main>` used to encapsulate the dominant and most important content within a webpage.

- `<footer>` placed at the bottom of the page, contains information such as: contact info, copyright info, terms of use, site map.

- `<section>` defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings. A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.

- `<article>` holds content that makes sense on its own: articles, blogs, comments, magazines. An `<article>` tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content begins and ends.

- `<aside>` is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. Usecases: Bibliographies, Endnotes, Comments, Pull quotes, Editorial sidebars, Additional information. Can be used alongside other elements such as article or section. The information within the `<article>` is the important content. Meanwhile the information within the <aside> enhances the information in `<article>` but is not required in order to understand it.

- `<figure>` is used to mark up a photo `<img />` and then `<figcaption` to define a caption for the photo.

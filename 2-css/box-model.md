## Box Model Areas

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as "living" inside of a box.

Each box is made up of distinc tbox model areas that all do a specific job.

1. **Content Area** - the area that the content lives in (width and height)
2. **Padding** - space between content area and border
3. **Border** - surrounds the padding box
4. **Margin** - space between border and the outside edge of the element

[**Box Model representation on codepen**](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/BaReoEV)

By default, the total dimensions of an element, are the sum of the content size, padding, border and margin.

**p.s.** Properties such as `outline` and `box-shadow` are painted on top, so they don't affect the size of our box.

<br>

## box-sizing

`box-sizing` property tells the box how to calculate its box size.

By default, all elements have this user agent style: `{ box-sizing: content-box; }`

This means that when you set dimensions such as `width` and `height`, they will be applied to the `content area`. If you then set `padding` and `border`, these values will be added to the content box's size.

We can reset this behavior of the box model for all html elements with:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This CSS rule selects every element in the document and every `::before` and `::after` pseudo element and applies `box-sizing: border-box`. This means that every element will now have this alternative box model.

This alternative box model tells CSS to apply the `width` and `height` to the border box instead of the content box. The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box.

<br>

## Height and Width

By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the content of the box. We can change that with:

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 350px;
}
```

<br>

## Border

Border is a line that surrounds an element. It can be set with a specific width, style and color:

```CSS
div {
    border: 2px solid red;
    border-radius: 5px;  /* 50% = circle */
}
```

`border-radius` will change the radius of the corners of an element's border box.

<br>

## Padding

The space between the content and the border of a box.

We can set padding for each side of the box separately.

```css
div {
  padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px; /* top right bottom left */
}
```

Padding is often used to expand the background color of the box.

<!-- Because padding is inside the box, the background of the box will be visible in the space that it creates. If our box has overflow rules set, such as overflow: auto or overflow: scroll, the scrollbars will occupy this space too. -->

<br>

## Margin

The space outside of the box.

```css
div {
  margin: 10px auto;
}
```

Using `margin: 0 auto;` we can center elements. `auto` on left and right instructs the browser to adjust margins until the element is centered within its containing element.

<br>

## Vertical Margin Collapse

Concept not applied to horizontal margin or to padding in general.

_Top and bottom (vertical) margins collapse._

Between two adjacent elements, both with defined margin, only the larger margin is set.

```css
.div-1 {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.div-2 {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```

In the example above, as this two margins meet, only the 20px padding of div-2 is applied.

<br>

## Minimum and Maximum Height and Width

CSS properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element's box can be sized to.

```css
div {
  max-width: 600px;
  min-width: 300px;

  max-height: 500px;
  min-height: 200px;
}
```

<br>

## Overflow

`overflow` property is set on a parent element to instruct the browser how to render child elements. It controls what happens to content that spills or overflows outside its box.

```css
div {
  overflow: visible;
}
```

- `visible` (default value) the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element.
- `hidden` any content that overflows will be hidden.
- `scroll` (a scrollbar will be added) the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.

For vertical or horizontal solutions: `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`.

<br>

## Resetting Defaults

Browsers have a default stylesheet, known as _user agent stylesheets_.

Many properties in CSS have a default value and donâ€™t have to be explicitly set in the stylesheet.

User agent stylesheets usually have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin.

Reset margin and padding default values:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

This is often the first CSS rule in an external stylesheet.

When properties are set to `0`, they do not require a unit of measurement.

<br>

## Visibility

```css
div {
  visibility: visible;
}
```

- `hidden` hides an element
- `visible` (default) displays an element
- `collapse` collapses an element

_Difference between display and visibility:_

- `display: none;` will completely remove an element from the document.
- `visibility: hidden` the element will not be visible, but the space reserved for it will. The element is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.

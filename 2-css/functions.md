# Functions

A **function** is a named, self-contained piece of code that completes a specific task.

We call a function by its name, and pass arguments into its parenthesis.

Functions can be nested within each other in some contexts, giving more flexibility.

Functions that return a value (e.g. `attr()`): you pass one or more arguments, and use them on the right side of the CSS declaration.

Functional selectors: `:is()` `:not()` into these functions we pass CSS selectors, and if there is a match, the CSS rule will apply to them.

Other examples of CSS functions: `var()` `minmax()` `fit-content()` `rgb()` `hsl()`

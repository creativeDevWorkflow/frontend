# Git Stash

While working on a file, you find a small bug in a separate file from a previous commit that needs to be fixed before you continue.

- `git stash ` this will store your work temporarily for later use in a hidden directory.

  At this point, you can switch branches and do work elsewhere, then commit.

- `git stash pop ` restore the previous code you were working on (once the bug is fixed).

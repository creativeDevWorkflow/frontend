**Git** is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account. You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching GitHub.

**GitHub** is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You do need to sign up for an account to use GitHub. _It's an online place to share work that is done using Git._

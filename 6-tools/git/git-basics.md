# Git

**Git** is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. It works by recording and storing changes you make to a project, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

## Git Init

Run the following command in a particular project directory to initialize git:

```
git init
```

## Git Workflow

A Git project can be thought of as having 3 parts:

1. **Working Directory:** where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.
2. **Staging Area:** where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.
3. **Repository:** where git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.

**The Git Workflow** consists of editing files in the working directory -> adding files to the staging area -> saving changes to the git repository.

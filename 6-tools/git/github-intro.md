## Pushing a local Repo to GitHub

- **Authentication** - first, we need to generate an SSH key that will authenticate our local machine. In your GitHub settings, go to SSH keys and generate a new key that you will use in your terminal when pushing repositories for the first time.

- **Create a new repository on GitHub**

- **Connect the newly created repository on GitHub with your existing work** - on the repo page, copy the suggested commands and paste them into the project's local terminal. This will create a remote repository and will push your local repo to the remote repo.

- Type your GitHub username and password if prompted.

- At this point, you should be able to see your local repo hosted on GitHub.

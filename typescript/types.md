# Types

**TypeScript** code is a superset of JavaScript code - it has all the features of traditional JavaScript but adds some new features (e.g. types).

TypeScript allows us to write JavaScript with a set of tools called a type system that can spot potential bugs in, clarify the structure of, and help refactor our code.

- TypeScript files extension: `main.ts`
- We run TypeScript code through the TS transpier, and if the code adheres to TypeScript's standards, it will output a JavaScript version of the file (.js)

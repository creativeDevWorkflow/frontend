# Forms best practices

- Intuitive UI

- **Short labels** are easier to scan, reduce visual clutter, and help users to understand what data is needed faster.

- Donâ€™t Use The Placeholder Attribute, use lavels instead

- Position the label above the form control

- Use the appropriate form controls. E.g. by using `type="tel"`, users on touch devices get a keypad optimized for entering numbers.

- Best: Single column forms, only one direction to follow.

- Ensure that forms are accessible for people who use only the keyboard to navigate websites.

- Make your buttons big enough, at least 48px in height.

- Include explicit error messages next to the form control when it is not filled out correctly.

- Make it clear to users what data to enter

- Make it clear to users which fields are required
